Simple Keylogger

This project implements a basic keylogger for educational purposes, demonstrating fundamental concepts of input monitoring and file I/O in Python. It is designed strictly for learning and should only be used on your own devices with full awareness of its functionality.
Project Overview
The Simple Keylogger is a Python-based program that captures keyboard inputs and logs them to a file. This project serves as a practical exploration of:

Event handling in Python
File operations for logging data
Basic input monitoring techniques

Features

Captures keyboard presses
Logs keystrokes to a local file
Simple start/stop functionality

Educational Objectives

Understand the mechanics of input monitoring
Learn about event-driven programming
Explore file handling in Python
Gain insights into potential security vulnerabilities

Security Awareness: This project demonstrates how keyloggers work, highlighting the importance of cybersecurity measures.

Implementation Details

Language: Python
Libraries: pynput for key monitoring
Output: Plain text file for logged keystrokes

**Usage (For Educational Purposes Only)**

Run the script on your personal device.
The program will start logging keystrokes to a file.
Use a predefined key combination to stop the logging process.
Examine the log file to understand how keystrokes are captured.
